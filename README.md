# trigger-mapper
Map analoge Xbox One triggers to keys on keyboard. Mapped keys can then be used in Trackmania to switch between cameras. 

# Usage
1. Edit bin/config.txt to select emulated keys and trigger thresholds
  * Valid values for LEFT_TRIGGER_KEY and RIGHT_TRIGGER_KEY are all lower case letters.
  * Valid values for LEFT_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD and RIGHT_TRIGGER_THRESHOLD are between 1 and 255.  
2. Start bin/trigger-mapper.exe
3. Bind mapped keys to any discrete input using controller triggers (binding process does not work properly yet; keep pressing trigger until bind is registered)
